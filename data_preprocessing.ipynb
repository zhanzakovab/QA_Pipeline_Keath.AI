Leadership is the capacity to guide a group towards achievement via persuasion, inspiration, and facilitation of others (Sharma and Jain, 2013). There is no universally accepted definition of leadership and management in the aviation industry. According to some individuals, leadership and management entails convincing followers to work towards a common goal and inspire them to do their best. Others think that a leader or a manager with exceptional human skills will always make the right call. Others consider leadership and management as an approach to work or an innate talent for making tough choices (Skybrary Aviation Safety, 2023). Poor leadership and management undoubtedly contributes to many additional shortcomings and errors in airline operations that contribute to week performance, financial losses along with the safety effects. As the state-owned carrier of Qatar, Qatar Airways is a major success story in the aviation sector. The The airline's growth has been attributed to the vision and leadership offered by the Group Chief Executive of the industry. Mr. Al Baker has guided Qatar Airways to become a regional as well as global aviation powerhouse, earning praise from customers from all over the world for the airline's high quality of service (Qatar Airways, 2017). Hence, to maintain the leadership and management for Qatar Airways is very crucial for their growth in this sector. Figure: Qatar Airways (Source: flickr, 2017) This report aims to critically evaluate the current management strategies of Qatar Airways to better understand the impact of this strategies to the organisation’s services. Another purpose is to identify the current challenges in the management practice of this airways and recommend strategies to mitigate them. Evaluation of emotional intelligence on management practice and development of management competence also are crucial to evaluate for this study. Task1: Management Practices Mission, values and management practices within the company Mission The primary mission of Qatar Airways is to become the world’s best Airline by providing incomparable service and quality (Qatar Airways, 2017). Another mission of the company is to grow into the finest airline in the world by consistently exceeding customer expectations. The mission statement serves as a guide for Qatar Airways, which guarantees that the company always takes the most effective strategy of action. The company's main objective is to secure a place to establish itself as a globally enduring brand and to separate itself from competition through superior service (Visionary Team, 2022). They are granted the right to deliver something which contributes to the greatness that underlies their very being. Values Service: Qatar Airways has committed itself to serving its clients the first-rate service that exceeds their high standards in every aspect. Their aim is to ensure that each consumer has a first-rate experience. Safety: Safety is of the utmost significance to Qatar Airways, and the airline implements all relevant safety rules religiously. Their commitment is on full display in what they do to fulfil and even beyond international requirements for safety. In 2003, Qatar Airways achieved the first-ever perfect rating on the International Air Transport Association's (IATA) Operations Safety Audit (Qatar Airways, 2017). The airline re-certified in 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, & June 2013. In order to facilitate code collaborating, the audit was meant to streamline and rationalise a number of security and safety precautions utilised by different airlines.It was determined how well Qatar Airways carried out in each of the categories: flight and ground operations; aircraft engineering and service; operational protection; cabin operations; and management technologies. Innovation: The airline's mission is to function as a global leader in aviation innovation. Qatar Airways is always on search for innovative methods to boost efficiency, provide better service to consumers, and get a leg up on competitors. Global connection: Qatar Airways' objective is to improve worldwide connectivity by offering convenient flight options and services that appeal to a broad spectrum of passengers (Istekher, 2023). They continually introduce new routes in an attempt to improve worldwide connectivity and serve additional places. Doha, Qatar's capital, functions as the airline's main hub, and from there as well its upwards of 130 passenger and freight aircraft fly to over 40 locations across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, South Asia, the Asia-Pacific region, North America, and South America (Qatar Airways, 2017). With a flying time of roughly 16 hours, making it one of the biggest non-stop flights from the world, Qatar Airways started its longest journey in its worldwide network scheduled each day from Doha to Houston, marking the company's third US destination in March 2009. Leadership values: Qatar Airways places an emphasis on good leadership and attributes Group Chief Executive, Mr. Akbar Al Baker, with leading the company to success (Qatar Airways, 2017). They have an unrelenting pursuit of leadership excellence across the board of directors. Corporate social responsibility: When it comes to both environmental integrity and corporate social responsibility, Qatar Airways and its related companies aim to set the standard. The airline is a leader in the study of next-generation fuels and provides charitable contributions to the neighbourhoods it serves (Sulistya and Ginaya, 2020). When it comes to fuel and environmental management, Qatar Airways works beyond what is required to secure an excellent future for the organisation, its employees, and the towns and villages in which it serves. Management practices Growth and expansion: Qatar Airways has been experiencing a period of significant expansion and rapid growth, with year-on-year growth reaching in the double digits (Qatar Airways, 2017). They are continually adding new destinations, increasing their fleet, and actively searching for potential to take up a bigger share of the market. Focus on customer: The airline strives to provide exceptional service and places an important focus on achieving complete customer satisfaction. They have been awarded with a number of distinctions, one of their biggest being the title of Skytrax Airline of the Year, which is a testimony to its commitment to providing services that are focused on customers (Qatar Airways, 2017). Partnership strategy: To broaden its network across the globe and enhance its standing in the aviation industry, Qatar Airways has deliberately formed strategic alliances. The fact they have collaborated alongside various airlines and companies as well as entered the Oneworld alliance indicates the dedication to working together for the greater good. Figure: Management practices of Qatar Airways (Source: Self-created) Technological investment: The airline company Qatar Airways specialises in cutting-edge technologies in order to improve the effectiveness of its operations and enhance the standard of the experience that it offers to its clients. Their choice for the Airbus A350 as well as their devotion to the ability to track through collaboration agreements as FlightAware and Aireon, LLC demonstrate the dedication to being at the forefront of creativity within the aviation industry as a whole (Qatar Airways, 2017). Safety commitment: It is clear that Qatar Airways maintains an intense emphasis on safety, as seen by their dedication to making sure they not only meet yet additionally surpass the criteria that are in place internationally. Their aggressive approach to aircraft surveillance and safety management can be seen by their relationship between FlightAware and Aireon, LLC in implementing the Global Beacon technology (Qatar Airways, 2017). The primary goal of Qatar Airways is to become a world-class airline known for its superior service and dependability. Strong leadership, inventiveness, worldwide connection, and a focus on customers are all highly sought after. Management at the airline prioritises growth, pleasing clients, relationships, technological advances, and safety. Critical assessment Management at Qatar Airways is generally in line with the organisation's stated goals and principles. However, multiple aspects need to be examined more closely. But there are several areas where further modification or upgrades have to be done in the Airline. Technological investment: Qatar Airways' dedication to development and safety is seen in the airline's purchase of modern technology including the Airbus A350 and aircraft tracking systems (Qatar Airways, 2017). However, these advancements are able to deliver their promised improvements to the customer encounter and efficiency in operation if their integration and the execution are effectively carried out. Passengers' ever-evolving wants and needs should drive continuous technological investment. Partnership strategy: Strategic alliances like joining Oneworld help Qatar Airways achieve its mission of improving connectivity worldwide. Although the airline is affiliated with a major multinational alliance, it is still just one Gulf carrier to do so, calling into question the possibility that such alliances are really helpful in fostering the desired network growth and streamlined travel options (Petcu, 2017). Working together with additional airlines could help achieve its objective of becoming a world-class airline. Task 2: Analysis of Business Challenges Key challenges in current environment Post Covid-19 challenge Qatar Airways, including the rest of the aviation sector, has been affected significantly by the situation of COVID-19 outbreak. Airline finances and operations have taken a major damage due to lockdown, restriction on travel, and lower customer demand. HE Akbar al-Baker, CEO of Qatar Airways Group, has stated that the airline sector will keep encountering challenges due to Covid -19 factors (John, 2022). These are rising oil prices, an inadequate supply of manpower, political unrest, an absence of assets in the growth of infrastructure, along with unwarranted limitations on aviation due to environmental concerns. Financial challenge In 2021, due to an A350 paint problem, Qatar Airways stopped certain of its aircraft and demanded penalties of $2 lakh each day for each parked plane. In retaliation, the European aerospace giant cancelled Qatar Airways' contract for 50 A321s, costing the airline over $6 billion (Times of India, 2023). Nonetheless, a glance at any public social media site will show that Qatar Airways is now widely regarded as prohibitively expensive and has fare discrimination. Exploring pricing-related concerns is crucial for Qatar Airways to examine the potential for improving its position. Figure: Key challenges of Qatar Airways Source: Self-created Social challenge Qatar Airways offers the exact same product to diverse customer bases at varying pricing points. According to people of Qatar, it makes no sense to charge more for a one-way ticket than a round-trip ticket (Al Saadi, 2012). It's also outrageous to find out that a direct trip will cost customers more than a flight that takes multiple routes to get to the same place. Due of the competitive nature of the airline industry, passengers are able to find ways around such price structures. Customers have said that Qatar Airways is not honest with them. The courts determined that the airlines' unclear policies, imprecise language, and inadequate explanations led to customer confusion. Operational challenge There aren't many airlines with the same ambitious growth goals as Qatar Airways and for this the hazards are substantial. It is challenging for quality assurance since it requires a wide variety of resources and skills, all of which must be maintained and developed over time. The people of Qatar consider Qatar Airways to be a part of their national airline; they believe they have a responsibility to shape the organization's future and want a voice in its management (Al Saadi, 2012). In a letter directed to the Qatar Civil Aviation Authority, activists intended to boycott of the Qatar Airways and complained about price discrimination, the availability of alcohol on flights, and the hiring of Qataris. This makes an negative impact on the organization's day-to-day operations. Management competency of creativity and innovation to resolve the challenges Qatar Airways maintains its unprecedented expansion and dominance in the aviation market. The below mentioned factors can be considered in order to discuss how Qatar Airway’s present management competency of creativity and innovation will enable its managers to overcome the highlighted challenges. Excellence service - The concepts of creativity and innovation are in harmony with Qatar Airways' goal of providing the best customer service. The airline can better serve its customers, provide unique offerings, and go above and beyond their expectations if it promotes an environment of innovation (Shams et al., 2012). Managers and leaders who are also creative and innovative are better able to spot problem areas and come up with effective, original solutions. Constant growth - Significant progress and development for Qatar Airways can be traced back to the company's openness to new ideas (Hasoh et al., 2021). The Airway service has been managed to identify and capture development possibilities by motivating leaders and managers to create solutions creatively, embrace novel concepts, and take measured risks. This skill is invaluable as the organisation meets the above mentioned challenges. Figure: Management competency of Qatar Airways to resolve the challenges (Source: Self-created) Brand recognition - The airline's repeated recognition as “Airline of the Year” is a testament to the leadership team's ability to think outside the box (Qatar Airways, 2017). Because of these characteristics, Qatar Airways has been able to emerge in the airline business and establish new standards of excellence. Progressive change and excellent solution to these challenges have a greater probability to be pushed by managers who encourage creativity and innovation. Strategic Alliances - Qatar Airways has demonstrated its forward-thinking mentality by affiliating with innovative organisations like “FlightAware” and “Aireon” and by joining the “Oneworld alliance” (Qatar Airways, 2017). The airline can gain access to untapped markets, cutting-edge technology, and specialised knowledge by actively searching out collaborative and creative partnership opportunities. Creative and innovative managers can spot and assess possible partnerships, leading to increased productivity and strength in dealing with of adversity. Mitigation process for the challenges The management competency of Decision-making of Qatar Airways should prioritise long-term thinking, openness, clear communication, and involvement of all relevant parties. Qatar Airways can increase its ability to respond to issues by implementing these changes. The airline will be able to make better judgements, respond to consumer issues, increase productivity, and avoid financial instability as a result. Managers can improve the company's financial standing by collaboration resources through strategic alliances with different airports, airlines, and industry players. Management of Qatar Airways needs to concentrate on cutting costs as much as possible without harming safety for passengers or service quality (Hasoh et al., 2021). The airline should look into expanding its source of income to lessen its vulnerability to market forces like increasing oil prices. The leadership and management of Qatar Airways needs to improve its risk evaluation and CSR management procedures so that it can better prepare for and respond to potential operational disruptions (Al Saadi, 2012). Investing heavily in staff' professional progress will help the airline achieve its ambitious expansion targets. There should be no disparities in price on Qatar Airways, and all tickets should cost the same. It is crucial to establish credibility and avoid client confusion by providing clear and precise information about price structures, coupons, and offers. Management of Qatar Airways should consult with stakeholders including customers, staff, and members of the public often to hear their opinions and find solutions to their problems. The management and leadership of Qatar Airways needs to make sure that the airline's decisions are respectful of its customers' and staff' cultural values as well as ethical standards. Task 3: The Impact of Emotional Intelligence Management Practises on Worker Engagement and Productivity Leaders evaluate their staff members based on a number of metrics, but two of the most important metrics are efficiency and punctuality. However, over time, these constraints reduce employees' development and output. It causes workers to leave the company in search of better chances that will help them develop professionally and personally. Leaders often rely on the most fundamental aspect of emotional intelligence when assessing employee performance (Issah, 2018). This information goes beyond measures of efficiency, punctuality, production, and aim to reveal the workers' underlying feelings and motivations with respect to their work. Emotional intelligence, according to experts, can serve as an innovative framework for leaders to use in measuring and tracking staff performance, one that promotes development, innovation, and originality in management (Brotheridge, 2006). Hence, emotional intelligence is significantly important for Qatar Airways management to motivate people to work hard and improving productivity in the workplace. The most successful managers and leaders value emotional intelligence as a key competency for understanding and resolving challenges among their teams. That's why it's crucial to incorporate emotional intelligence into Qatar Airways's management practise. Leaders and managers with high emotional intelligence are aware of and able to regulate their own feelings and those of those around them. When compared to fundamental concepts and best practises in the field, Qatar Airways' strategy for Emotional Intelligence management may be assessed and examined for its efficacy in boosting employee engagement as well as enhancing organisational performance. Self-Awareness: Self-aware leaders in Qatar Airways are able to capitalise on their best qualities and address their flaws through self-reflection and the pursuit of external resources. Decisions, communications, and employee involvement all benefit from this kind of heightened consciousness. This helps to improve morale in the workplace, strengthen teams, and settle disagreements in the organisation. Leaders that are self-aware are better equipped to live up to the standards they've set for themselves (Jordan and Ashkanasy, 2006). Leaders with a healthy sense of self-awareness are more inclined to passenger feedback, take inventory of their actions, and seek out ways to grow professionally. An environment of innovation and growth can flourish when employees adopt a mindset of continual improvement in Qatar Airways. The impact of self-aware leaders can be harmful as it leads to overthinking situation. This usually implies that Qatar Airways management will expend more mental energy than is necessary because of high self-awareness level. Empathy Management at Qatar Airways appears to place priority on focusing as well as responding to its customers, as seen by the airline's record of achievements. In order to provide outstanding service, it is likely that all staff members share this appreciation. Management styles that emphasise compassion and empathy are evident under Mr. Akbar Al Baker's energetic leadership as Group Chief Executive (Qatar Airways, 2017). A leader with these characteristics will be able to establish an environment where workers feel valued and appreciated, which will in turn encourage greater teamwork, creativity, and advancement (Batool, 2013). The fact that Qatar Airways has been able to cultivate a healthy workplace culture that has won the company praise from across the world suggests that its leadership values its employees' health and happiness. Empathy may be a powerful tool for Qatar Airways success, but it can be misused if it is not well understood or falls into inappropriate hands. Further, it's possible to develop biases when leaders or managers over-empathize with others that share their own characteristics. Employee's faith in the leader's noble intentions can be weakened when one of these things happens. Figure: Aspects of Emotional Intelligence (Source: weebly, 2023) Self-regulation The term “self-regulation” is commonly used to describe an organization's capacity to establish and uphold its own rules, regulations, and ethical norms without the need for outside oversight or enforcement (Batool, 2013). Mechanisms for internal control, reporting, and auditing are required to maintain self-regulation. The accomplishments and successes of Qatar Airways suggest the company uses strong management practises, possibly including certain forms of self-regulation (Qatar Airways, 2017). Because of its prominence in the airline industry, Qatar Airways is expected to comply with and follow established operating standards, safety regulations, and customer service rules in order to provide its passengers with consistent, high-quality service. Motivation for monitoring and enforcing standards are necessary in Qatar Airways, and self-regulatory systems that lack formal support likely to be ineffective. Self-regulation has traditionally suffered from problems with enforcement and restitution. Poor self-regulation in Qatar Airways management can negatively impact on confidence level and self-esteem for which a manager or leader may behave inappropriately with their team. Motivation Since the reactivation in 1997, inspired by His Highness The Father Emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, shows the company's dedication to its mission. Staff morale is able to be enhanced by these leaders who can see the broader aspect and inspire them to reach towards excellence in terms of quality and customer service. Mr. Al Baker's charismatic leadership style certainly had a significant influence in propelling Qatar Airways to become a multi-award winning airline (Qatar Airways, 2017). The constant prizes and acknowledgment Qatar Airways receives, such as “Airline of the Year” and “Skytrax awards”, serves as a great source of pride for the staff. Qatar Airways' considerable development and strategic commitments, such as the company's large aircraft orders, also signify potential for advancement for current personnel. The negative impacts of low employee motivation in Qatar Airways can increase turnover of employees, a drop in involvement, a breakdown in communication, including a decrease output. Social skill Since Qatar Airways is firmly dedicated to providing first-rate service, it's safe to assume that the organisation places an emphasis on and encourages the development of interpersonal skills among its managers. Customer relationships can only flourish when both parties involved are able to listen to one another, show compassion, and adapt to one another's requirements and desires (Batool, 2013). Mr. Akbar Al Baker's direction and the hard work of everyone at Qatar Airways have led to the organisation’s remarkable success. After only a year as a member of Oneworld, Qatar Airways has fully embraced the global alliance (Qatar Airways, 2017). The airline's capacity to work with others and make good connections with relevant parties is highlighted by this. Partnership building, agreement negotiation, and upholding harmonious professional relationships all require strong social skills. Uncertainty and misunderstanding stemming from a lack of shareholder and customer communication and interaction can have a negative impact on production as well as morale in Qatar Airways. Task 4: Management competencies development Using appropriate models and frameworks, researchers may analyse how well Qatar Airways’ values connect with the management competences of managing resilience and managing stakeholder relationships. Using the framework, managing resilience and managing stakeholder relationships can be done. Managing resilience Organisational resilience is characterised as the capacity to persevere and even thrive in an environment of adversity. Using the “Competing Values Framework (CVF)”, one can determine if Qatar Airways' values assist resilience management. Collaborate, produce, control, and compete are the four recommended managerial competencies in the CVF (Kucsera, 2021). Competencies in teamwork and creativity are useful in the overall setting of resilience management. Collaborate: Cooperation, teamwork, and connection are the focus of this competency. It involves allowing workers to share ideas openly, trust others, and work collectively. The significance placed on both service quality and cooperation by Qatar Airways’ fundamental principles shows the company’s devotion to working together. They take teamwork-oriented tactics since they value their employees and strive to satisfy or exceed the demands of their clients. The degree to which an organisation actively promotes and promotes cooperation might be difficult to determine without further details on internal practises and worker opinions. Create: This competency places an enormous value on learning, adaptation, and innovation. It involves encouraging artistic expression, being open to new experiences, and constantly looking for additional chances for growth in oneself (Al Naimi et al., 2021). According to the offered data, creativity and versatility are not among Qatar Airways' basic values. However, their plans for growth and development are made clear by their focus on development, spending on technology, and dedication to becoming a regional and around the world aviation leader. It demonstrates a willingness to adapt to new ideas and the capacity to adjust to changes in the market. However, without further information, judging the company's success in promoting and emphasising imaginative thinking and innovation in the working environment is problematic. Crisis response: One can expect Qatar Airways to have solid procedures for emergencies in place. Natural disasters, worries about safety, and global health emergencies would all be included in such arrangements (Al Naimi et al., 2021). It's possible that the airline has emergency response planners and safety and health representatives on staff at all times. Robust risk management: Risk management processes would be established at Qatar Airways to help detect, evaluate, and remove threats. Some instances of this are making periodic risk evaluations, putting into effect safeguards, as well as maintaining an eye out for and responding to new threats. The airline may mitigate disruptions and enhance its ability to recover out of setbacks if it takes a preventive approach to risk mitigation. Figure: Managing Resilience of Qatar Airways (Source: Self-created) Operations: A resilient company like Qatar Airways might use tactics that are both flexible and nimble. Alternatives might include different flight paths or adjusting customer service in response to demand swings. The airline's ability to quickly adapt to novel circumstances and keep offering service depends on the agility of the way it operates. Support and wellbeing: Keeping the employees healthy and happy is a crucial component of resilience management. It's likely that Qatar Airways has efforts and programmes in place that boost the mental health of its staff members, offer aid in times of crisis, and supply chances for career and personal growth. The airline can build a strong, dynamic team by emphasising the health and wellbeing of its employees. Learning and improvement: A key characteristic of resilient organisations is a commitment to reflection and reform. After an event, Qatar Airways could launch an investigation to determine exactly what went wrong and how to optimally utilise the lessons gained. Because of this willingness to pursue lifelong education, the company is able to develop into more resilient people as time goes on. Engagement of stakeholders: Managing resilience involves commitment from and honest discussion with every party that is pertinent. During difficult circumstances, Qatar Airways would most likely maintain lines of communication open with clients, staff members, partners, and regulatory agencies (Lohmann and Vianna, 2016). The airline can keep their stakeholders' trust, endure less negative publicity, and deal with disasters better if it keeps them updated and answers to their issues. Although there is a relationship between Qatar Airways' stated values and the management competence of managing resilience, more information is required to draw any solid inferences about the extent to which this alignment is actually achieved. Stakeholder relationship management Strong connections, continued trust, and mutually beneficial solutions can only be accomplished through meticulous stakeholder management (Bourne, 2009). The Stakeholder Management Framework and the Stakeholder Theory are able to be used to evaluate Qatar Airways' techniques for managing its stakeholders. Stakeholder theory: According to this theory, enterprises should take into consideration the wants and worries of a wide variety of stakeholders, particularly their clients and customers, their staff members and members of their community, and their investors (Kirat, 2015). The value of customers as shareholders is reflected in Qatar Airways' values, which place a premium priority on offering outstanding customer service and listening to feedback from passengers. The airline appreciates the value of its employees and shows this by emphasising their safety and treating them as a valuable asset. It can be challenging to evaluate Qatar Airways’ comprehensive approach to managing stakeholder relations without more information on how the company actively interacts with and deals with the requirements of other participants, such as neighbourhoods and investors. Stakeholder management at Qatar Airways entails building and maintaining beneficial relationships with the airline's many regions, including passengers, workers, communities, authorities, and suppliers (Lohmann and Vianna, 2016). There may not be any public information regarding how Qatar Airways conducts its stakeholder relations, but the company can make a few educated assumptions based on conventional industry behaviour and principles. Customer satisfaction: As the company's fundamental values show, excellent client service is one of Qatar Airways' primary goals. It's likely that the airline's primary goals are providing excellent service, fulfilling passengers' needs, as well as making their flights pleasurable. The views of consumers on Qatar Airways' services and policies could be obtained from online questionnaires, direct contact with customer support members, and social media. Employee development and engagement: Qatar Airways may place an advantage on employee involvement and development as professionals because of the value it places on its workforce. The airline probably creates an enjoyable work atmosphere, provides employees with a chance to learn and develop and invites their input into company matters. Employees who feel invested in the job are more inclined to go beyond what is required for those they serve. Alliances and partnership: As an associate of the Oneworld alliance, Qatar Airways demonstrated its dedication to working with other aircraft (Qatar Airways, 2017). The airline may interact with third parties (such as additional airlines, transportation hubs, and service providers) to improve connectivity, improve passenger services, and to share knowledge and expertise. Having an established framework of alliances and collaboration allows an airline to better serve its consumers and cover additional ground. Figure: Stakeholder relationship management (Source: Self-created) Community involvement: Through its corporate social responsibility (CSR) projects, Qatar Airways helps local communities. The airline can give back to activities that have a positive social, environmental, or educational impact. These initiatives show that the airline values being a responsible business entity and contribute to strengthening the organisation's reputation (Sulistya and Ginaya, 2020). To help meet the needs of society, Qatar Airways may sponsor social gatherings or form relationships with philanthropic organisations. The airline strengthens its relationship to local stakeholders and promotes its goodwill through charitable activities. Government relations: Qatar Airways, the national airline of Qatar, has strong links to the government and regulatory organisations. The airline strictly adheres to all applicable security, privacy, and operation rules, both domestic and abroad. Qatar Airways engages closely with aviation regulators to solve industry problems, influence legislation, and improve the aerospace sector as a whole (Petcu, 2017). The airline is better able to stand up for industry and consumer needs and successfully navigate regulated settings provided it has solid relations with government stakeholders. Relation with investors: Qatar Airways may employ an investor relations staff for investors, analysts, and the business community. Reports on finances, investor demonstrations, and shareholder meetings could inform stakeholders about the transport company's performance, methods, and future plans. Stakeholder engagement framework: According to this concept, stakeholders need to be actively managed by first being identified, then having their objectives understood, and finally being involved in decision-making (Smith, 2017). Qatar Airways’ participation in the Oneworld partnership and its strategic alliances show its commitment to working together and connecting with other industry participants, but the presented information does not reference the airline's engagement with stakeholders practises. The level to which an organisation actively connects with stakeholders outside consumers and staff requires more particular information Managing relationships among stakeholders on multiple fronts was an important goal for Qatar Airways. The airline's long-term success depends on its ability to make a difference for its stakeholders in the future, so it places a premium on excellent customer service, employee involvement, alliances, compliance with laws and regulations, and community service. Conclusion Certainly, Qatar Airways has accomplished tremendous achievement and has proven itself as one of the greatest airlines in the market. The airline service has clearly shown that the organisation is led by people who can make strategic decisions and are dedicated to achieving the highest standards in their industry. The following are some suggestions Qatar Airways can use to continue expanding and strengthening its reputation as an excellent global airline. A tradition of creativity and innovation should be fostered at Qatar Airways. To achieve this goal, they must routinely assess their offerings, operations, and passenger input for potential development opportunities. A key factor for Qatar Airways's achievement is the quality and commitment of its employees (Qatar Airways, 2017). Maintaining this level of accomplishment requires giving training and professional development opportunities for existing employees a high priority. In order to minimise its impact on the environment, Qatar Airways should prioritise sustainable practises including acquiring more fuel-efficient planes and other alternative method (Wang, 2021). Qatar Airways can strengthen its network and increase its worldwide reach by forming and maintaining effective partnerships with various airports, airlines, including service providers. Qatar Airways can keep providing world-class service to passengers and maintaining its position as a go-to airline by responding to customers' evolving needs, embracing new technologies, and displaying a dedication to excellence.

These are well-integrated into the discussion, showing engagement with the module content. - The application of knowledge to Mrs. Terry's scenario is effective, particularly in discussing the use of PAINAD for pain assessment and the importance of informed consent. - The structure of the essay is clear, with a defined introduction, body, and conclusion, which aids in the logical flow of the argument. Areas for Development: - The essay could benefit from a deeper exploration of specific nursing theories and how they apply to Mrs. Terry's care. Consider integrating more detailed discussions on legal and ethical frameworks. - While the analysis is logical, it lacks depth in critically evaluating key issues such as patient confidentiality and the multidisciplinary approach. More critical engagement with these topics would strengthen the essay. - The use of evidence is relevant but could be more extensive. Incorporating a wider range of recent studies or specific examples from practice would enhance the argument. Next Steps: - To improve depth, consider exploring additional nursing theories and their practical applications in similar scenarios. This could involve more detailed case studies or examples. - Enhance critical evaluation by engaging more deeply with the implications of key issues like patient confidentiality and multidisciplinary collaboration. This might involve discussing potential challenges and solutions in these areas. - Strengthen the use of evidence by integrating more diverse sources.

This indicates a successful identification of key challenges, acknowledging the complex environment in which Qatar Airways operates, particularly under the unprecedented pressures of the global pandemic and its financial repercussions on the aviation industry. However, when it comes to addressing these challenges through creative problem-solving and innovation, the submission falls short. It mentions the importance of creativity and innovation but does not provide detailed examples or relevant theories to back up this claim. The lack of specificity and depth in this area suggests a superficial treatment of how Qatar Airways employs innovative strategies to navigate its challenges. Furthermore, the submission does not mention specific models or theories that foster creativity and innovation at Qatar Airways, leaving a gap in the analysis. The discussion on innovation lacks depth and clarity, failing to provide a clear framework for understanding how the company might leverage creativity and innovation to overcome its identified challenges. Moreover, the submission inadequately links the identified challenges to strategic decisions within management practices. The discussion on how challenges influence strategic decisions is not explored in depth, which is a critical oversight. Understanding the connection between the challenges faced by the company and the strategic decisions made in response is essential for a comprehensive analysis. This linkage is crucial for demonstrating a thorough understanding of the strategic management process within the context of Qatar Airways. In summary, while the submission successfully identifies the challenges faced by Qatar Airways, it lacks detailed exploration of creative problem-solving and the application of innovation frameworks.
